# PyBump

A simple semantic versioning script.

This will update the version in your ./resources/version.txt file according to
semantic versioning.

### Prerequisites

 - python 3.6.4 or later

### Running

type `python pybump` into your terminal. Make it an alias, if you wish...

### Note:

This is just a snippet taken from a previous project (and thus is quite
specific). Future dev might include updating a changelog file instead of a
version file, and committing said version changes to git.
